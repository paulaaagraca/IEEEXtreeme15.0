# Xtreme Winners

Write a program that reads an IEEEXtreme winner team name and prints the number of the competition edition they won.

The programs which correctly solve all 1414 years will be scored by the number of characters in the source code (the shorter the better). You must pass all test cases (including the examples) to get any points for this task.

We're also making it incredibly easy for you, by just giving your the chronological list of winners:

Team 1
Knapsackers@UNT
MoraSeekers
SurpriseTeam
CuSAT
DongskarPedongi
cofrades
viRUs
TeamName
TeamEPFL1
whatevs
WildCornAncestors
TheCornInTheFields
Aurora


## Standard input
The first line will contain the name of a team that won a past Xtreme.

## Standard output
The first line of your output should contain a single integer between 11 and 1414, the number of the edition that was won by the team in the input.

## Constraints and notes
- Team names are always provided as they are listed above, with the same letter cases and format.
- You must solve all tests, including the examples, correctly to get any points.
- The scoring function will be (\frac{\text{ShortestCode}}{\text{YourSourceLength}})^2 , where \text{ShortestCode}ShortestCode is the shortest competitor code that passes all tests.
- For convenience, whitespaces in the beginning and end of the solution code will be ignored. All the other characters are counted.
